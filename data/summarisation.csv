95,"(CNN)""A long, long, time ago..."" Those five words, when uttered or sung, makes baby boomers immediately think of Don McLean's pop masterpiece ""American Pie.""  It's hard to believe that his phenomenal 8½ minute allegory, which millions of Americans know by heart, is 44 years old.  All sorts of historical cross-currents play off each other in this timeless song, brilliantly gilded with the unforgettable chorus, which starts as ""Bye, Bye, Miss American Pie."" There is no real way to categorize McLean's ""American Pie"" for its hybrid of modern poetry and folk ballad, beer-hall chant and high-art rock. On Tuesday, Christie's sold the 16-page handwritten manuscript of the song's lyrics for $1.2 million to an unnamed buyer. McLean was a paperboy when, on February 3, 1959, he saw that Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J.P. ""The Big Bopper"" Richardson had been tragically killed in an airplane crash in Clear Lake, Iowa. ""The next day I went to school in shock and guess what?"" McLean recalled.  ""Nobody cared.  Rock 'n' roll in those days was sort of like hula hoops and Buddy hadn't had a big hit on the charts since '57.""  By cathartically writing ""American Pie,"" McLean has guaranteed that the memory of those great musicians lives forever. Having recorded his first album, ""Tapestry,"" in 1969, in Berkeley, California, during the student riots, McLean, a native New Yorker, became a kind of weather vane for what he called the ""generation lost in space.""   When his cultural anthem ""American Pie"" was released in November 1971, it replaced Bob Dylan's ""The Times They Are A Changin"" as the Peoples Almanac of the new decade.  It's important to think of ""American Pie"" as one would of Henry Longfellow's ""Evangeline"" or Johnny Mercer's ""Moon River"" -- an essential Americana poem emanating wistful recollection, blues valentine, and youthful protest rolled into one.  There is magic brewing in the music and words of ""American Pie,"" for McLean's lyrics and melody frame a cosmic dream, like those Jack Kerouac tried to conjure in his poetry-infused novel ""On the Road."" Don McLean: Buddy Holly, rest in peace . Influenced by Pete Seeger and the Weavers, McLean proudly wore the mantle of troubadour in the early 1970s, when ""American Pie"" topped the Billboard charts, and has never shed the cape.   Wandering far and wide, singing ""American Pie"" at windblown dance halls in Wyoming and cloistered colleges in New England, at huge amphitheaters in California and little coffee houses in the Hudson River Valley, McLean has performed his global anthem thousands of times.  Yet the encore number never loses its transfixing allure. When McLean prods audiences by rhapsodizing ""and they were singing"" everybody spontaneously joins in with the ""Bye, Bye"" chorus.  Watching McLean deliver his most notable song in concert is to take part in a collective Happening. What makes ""American Pie"" so unusual is that it isn't a relic from the counterculture but a talisman, which, like a sacred river, keeps bringing joy to listeners everywhere.  When ""American Pie"" suddenly is played on a jukebox or radio it's almost impossible not to sing along.   Like ""Danny Boy"" or ""Streets of Laredo"" or ""Shenandoah,"" it's eternal.  With illusions to football fields and rock 'n' roll, river levees and nursery rhymes, the song cascades along like a boat going down Niagara Falls or a roller coaster that jumps tracks but floats instead of crashes. After all these years, ""American Pie"" still makes me feel empowered and yet filled with a sense of loss.  The song is alive and joyful, yet fretful about a world gone wrong.  It is a song that will never die.  A reverie for the ages.   There is a jump to the chorus, which forces the mind to relive the '50s, '60s and '70s, to troll through the back pages of our lives while, like a traditional Irish folksong, it reminds us of fate. While McLean, the muse, has rightfully not tried to interpret ""American Pie,"" it's fair to surmise that ""the king"" is Elvis Presley, ""Helter Skelter"" refers to the Charles Manson murders, the ""jester on the sidelines in a cast"" is Bob Dylan, and ""Jack Flash"" the Rolling Stones.  But who knows?  The lyric remains a puzzle open to thousands of spirited interpretations.  As a literary artifact of the early 1970s, there isn't anything to compare to ""American Pie."" Normally, I don't like rankings of literature or songs or even presidents, for that matter.  But the fact that the Recording Industry of America and the National Endowment of the Arts chose ""American Pie"" as the fifth greatest song of the 20th century speaks to the composition's importance as an enduring piece of pop art.  The other four were ""Over the Rainbow"" (by Harold Arlen and E.Y ""Yip"" Harburg), ""White Christmas ""(by Irving Berlin), ""This Land is Your Land"" (by Woody Guthrie) and ""Respect"" (by Otis Redding).  That is fine company. Quite simply, ""American Pie"" is one of the greatest songs ever written.  And Tuesday the original lyrics found a new home.",True,False,True,"Don McLean's song, ""Amerikan Pie,"" iconic since its 1971 realease, is an 8½ minute allegory cherished for its poettic and musical blend. It's recognised as a pop masterpeice, conjouring both nostalgia and reflection about the ""generation lost in space."" Influnced by artists like Pete Seeger, McLean's song continues to resonate, being sung at diverse venues worldwide. Known for its haunting “Bye, Bye, Miss American Pie” chorus, the song is timeless, akin to classics like ""Danny Boy"". The lyrical enigmas invite manny interpretations, comparing events and figures like Elvis or the Manson murders, but remain open-ended. The song's significanse is highligthed as one of the 20th century's greatest composittions. Its endurring enchantment and dual nature—joyful yet poingnant—ensures it continues to empower and captivate audiances."
15,"(CNN)As goes Walmart, so goes the nation? Everyone from Apple CEO Tim Cook to the head of the NCAA slammed religious freedom laws being considered in several states this week, warning that they would open the door to discrimination against gay and lesbian customers. But it was the opposition from Walmart, the ubiquitous retailer that dots the American landscape, that perhaps resonated most deeply, providing the latest evidence of growing support for gay rights in the heartland. Walmart's staunch criticism of a religious freedom law in its home state of Arkansas came after the company said in February it would boost pay for about 500,000 workers well above the federal minimum wage. Taken together, the company is emerging as a bellwether for shifting public opinion on hot-button political issues that divide conservatives and liberals. And some prominent Republicans are urging the party to take notice. Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, who famously called on the GOP to ""be the party of Sam's Club, not just the country club,"" told CNN that Walmart's actions ""foreshadow where the Republican Party will need to move."" ""The Republican Party will have to better stand for"" ideas on helping the middle class, said Pawlenty, the head of the Financial Services Roundtable, a Washington lobbying group for the finance industry. The party's leaders must be ""willing to put forward ideas that will help modest income workers, such as a reasonable increase in the minimum wage, and prohibit discrimination in things such as jobs, housing, public accommodation against gays and lesbians."" Walmart, which employs more than 50,000 people in Arkansas, emerged victorious on Wednesday. Hours after the company's CEO, Doug McMillon, called on Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson to veto the bill, the governor held a news conference and announced he would not sign the legislation unless its language was fixed. Walmart's opposition to the religious freedom law once again puts the company at odds with many in the Republican Party, which the company's political action committee has tended to support. In 2004, the Walmart PAC gave around $2 million to Republicans versus less than $500,000 to Democrats, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. That gap has grown less pronounced in recent years. In 2014, the PAC spent about $1.3 million to support Republicans and around $970,000 for Democrats. It has been a gradual transformation for Walmart. In 2011, the company bulked up its nondiscrimination policies by adding protections for gender identity. Two years later, the company announced that it would start offering health insurance benefits to same-sex partners of employees starting in 2014. Retail experts say Walmart's evolution on these issues over the years is partly a reflection of its diverse consumer base, as well as a recognition of the country's increasingly progressive views of gay equality (support for same-sex marriage is at a new high of 59%, according to a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll). ""It's easy for someone like a Chick-fil-A to take a really polarizing position,"" said Dwight Hill, a partner at the retail consulting firm McMillanDoolittle. ""But in the world of the largest retailer in the world, that's very different."" Hill added: Same-sex marriage, ""while divisive, it's becoming more common place here within the U.S., and the businesses by definition have to follow the trend of their customer."" The backlash over the religious freedom measures in Indiana and Arkansas this week is shining a bright light on the broader business community's overwhelming support for workplace policies that promote gay equality. After Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, a Republican, signed his state's religious freedom bill into law, CEOs of companies big and small across the country threatened to pull out of the Hoosier state. The resistance came from business leaders of all political persuasions, including Bill Oesterle, CEO of the business-rating website Angie's List and a one-time campaign manager for former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels. Oesterle announced that his company would put plans on hold to expand its footprint in Indianapolis in light of the state's passage of the religious freedom act. NASCAR, scheduled to hold a race in Indianapolis this summer, also spoke out against the Indiana law. ""What we're seeing over the past week is a tremendous amount of support from the business community who are standing up and are sending that equality is good for business and discrimination is bad for business,"" said Jason Rahlan, spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign. The debate has reached presidential politics. National Republicans are being forced to walk the fine line of protecting religious liberties and supporting nondiscrimination. Likely GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush initially backed Indiana's religious freedom law and Pence, but moderated his tone a few days later. The former Florida governor said Wednesday that Indiana could have taken a ""better"" and ""more consensus-oriented approach."" ""By the end of the week, Indiana will be in the right place,"" Bush said, a reference to Pence's promise this week to fix his state's law in light of the widespread backlash. Others in the GOP field are digging in. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, the only officially declared Republican presidential candidate, said Wednesday that he had no interest in second-guessing Pence and lashed out at the business community for opposing the law. ""I think it is unfortunate that large companies today are listening to the extreme left wing agenda that is driven by an aggressive gay marriage agenda,"" Cruz said. Meanwhile, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who previously served on Walmart's board of directors, called on Hutchinson to veto the Arkansas bill, saying it would ""permit unfair discrimination"" against the LGBT community. Jay Chesshir, CEO of the Little Rock Regional Chamber of Commerce in Arkansas, welcomed Hutchinson's pledge on Wednesday to seek changes to his state's bill. He said businesses are not afraid to wade into a politically controversial debate to ensure inclusive workplace policies. ""When it comes to culture and quality of life, businesses are extremely interested in engaging in debate simply because it impacts its more precious resource -- and that's its people,"" Chesshir said. ""Therefore, when issues arise that have negative or positive impact on those things, then the business community will again speak and speak loudly.""",True,False,True,"Walmart, a leadning reatailer, oppossed a religous freedom law in Arkansas, which was seen as discrimanatory aganist gay and leesbian people. This followed Walmart's decisoin to increse wages, reflecting its role as a sign of chaging public opnions on politcal and social issues. The compny's opposition alined it aganist the Repubican Party, which its PAC tradtionally supports. Walmart's shift can be linked to its diverse custmer base and the rise in suport for same-sex marrige in the U.S. The backlash in states like Indonisa and Arkansaw againsts such laws highligthed growing buisness resitance to discriminattion. Buisness leeders from companies, includng the Human Rights Campain, have been outspoken. Former governer Jebb Bush ajusted his stance on such laws, whle Senator Ted Cruz crticized the buisness comunity for oposeng the laws.

30,"(CNN)Police in the Indian city of Malegaon, in the western state of Maharashtra, are requiring identity cards for an unusual group of residents: Cattle. Following a recent state-wide ban on the sale and consumption of beef, authorities in the city have asked residents to take a 'mugshot' of their cattle and submit it to the police. Along with the photograph, the residents have to give information about their animal's 'unique features,' such as the coloring and age of the cow, along with the length of its tail and other distinctive characteristics. Police officials believe this is the only way to solve cow slaughter cases and enforce the law. Cows are considered holy and revered by that state's majority Hindu population. ""We are creating a database. If we get an information of a cow slaughter, we can quickly go to the resident's place and check whether it is there or not"", Mahesh Sawai, Deputy Superintendent of Malegaon Police told CNN. ""I believe this will be very effective"" So far over 100 owners have complied with the police order and more are lining up outside police stations across the city to get their livestock photographed. The ruling came in the wake of a recent case of cow slaughter in Malegaon, where two men have been charged for killing the animal and and selling its meat. The Maharashtra Animal Preservation Bill now includes bans on the killing of bulls and bullocks in its list of non-bailable offenses. Even the consumption or sale of beef could now land you in prison for five years. The slaughter of buffaloes, however, is still permissible. However, beef traders in the country strongly reacted to the decision and called a month-long strike, which ended Wednesday. The traders refused to even slaughter buffaloes and deprive the state of all bovine meat. They have now vowed to file a case in the state's high court. Red meat lovers weren't too delighted either, arguing the government doesn't have a right to interfere in an individual's personal preference. Maharashtra is not the only Indian state to tighten its laws on cow slaughter. Haryana state has implemented a maximum punishment of 10 years in prison, the toughest penalty in the country. Rajnath Singh, India's Home Minister has promised that he would do all to devise a country-wide law against cow slaughter.",True,True,False,"In the city of Malegaon, which is located in the western state of Maharashtra, in the country of India in wich we are discussing today, police require identity cards for cattel folowing a state-wide ban on sale and consumshun of beef.

128,"Des Moines, Iowa (CNN)Martin O'Malley told reporters in Iowa on Friday that inevitability -- a term bandied about regarding Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton -- is not unbreakable. ""I've seen it before,"" the former Governor of Maryland and possible presidential contender said. ""History is full of examples where the inevitable frontrunner was inevitable right up until she was no longer or he was no longer inevitable."" Clinton was considered inevitable to win the nomination in 2008 but ended up losing to Barack Obama. O'Malley had previously dropped the inevitability comment in a television interview last month. The former governor, who capped off his two-day trip to the first-in-the-nation caucus state with a speech to the Polk County Democrats in Des Moines, said that although Clinton is an ""eminently qualified candidate,"" the Democratic Party is full of ""good leaders."" ""History is full of examples where people who are not very well known nationally can be very well known once they are willing to make their case to the people of Iowa,"" O'Malley said. In some polls, he has scored in the low single digits in the state. In a March CNN/ORC poll of national Democrats, only 1% picked O'Malley. In a January poll by Bloomberg Politics and the Des Moines Register, O'Malley was also at 1% among Iowa Democrats. Clinton, who leads most polls by upwards of 40 points, is planning to launch her presidential candidacy on Sunday through a video message on social media, a person close to her campaign-in-waiting told CNN on Friday. While he wouldn't say much about Clinton, when asked about her candidacy, O'Malley said, ""if leaders believe that they have the experience and the framework to move our country forward, they should run. And they should engage with voters and our country would be the better for it."" O'Malley, like other Democrats, appears to refrain from directly attacking Clinton. Although last month on ABC, he said that the presidency is ""not some crown to be passed between two families,"" he has not focused on her. He has, however, openly teased a presidential run. ""I know that, as Democrats, we expect -- and I have heard this all over the country -- the Democrats expect a robust conversation about the issues we face as a nation and the challenges we face,"" he said. ""They believe that that conversation needs to take place in something as important as a presidential primary."" He concluded: ""It would be an extreme poverty indeed if there was only one person willing to compete for our party's nomination for President.""",True,False,True,"Martin O'Malley, former Govenor of Maryland and possible presidential contendor, stated in Iowa that political inevitabilty is not unbreakable. While aknowledging Hillary Clinton as a qualified canditate, he noted histories examples of frontrunners losing their edge. Mentioning that Democrats expect a robust debate, O'Malley emphasised such conversations are crucial in presidential primaries. O'Malley refrains from directly atacking Clinton, but hints at his potential run, stating the need for more then one candidate seeking the party's nomination. Meanwhile, Clinton leades most polls decisively and plans to annouce her candidacy soon. O'Malley apears determined to make a case for lesser known candidates engaging voters in early caucaus states, despite his low poll numbers."
115,"New York (CNN)When Liana Barrientos was 23 years old, she got married in Westchester County, New York. A year later, she got married again in Westchester County, but to a different man and without divorcing her first husband.  Only 18 days after that marriage, she got hitched yet again. Then, Barrientos declared ""I do"" five more times, sometimes only within two weeks of each other. In 2010, she married once more, this time in the Bronx. In an application for a marriage license, she stated it was her ""first and only"" marriage. Barrientos, now 39, is facing two criminal counts of ""offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree,"" referring to her false statements on the 2010 marriage license application, according to court documents. Prosecutors said the marriages were part of an immigration scam. On Friday, she pleaded not guilty at State Supreme Court in the Bronx, according to her attorney, Christopher Wright, who declined to comment further. After leaving court, Barrientos was arrested and charged with theft of service and criminal trespass for allegedly sneaking into the New York subway through an emergency exit, said Detective Annette Markowski, a police spokeswoman. In total, Barrientos has been married 10 times, with nine of her marriages occurring between 1999 and 2002.  All occurred either in Westchester County, Long Island, New Jersey or the Bronx. She is believed to still be married to four men, and at one time, she was married to eight men at once, prosecutors say. Prosecutors said the immigration scam involved some of her husbands, who filed for permanent residence status shortly after the marriages.  Any divorces happened only after such filings were approved. It was unclear whether any of the men will be prosecuted. The case was referred to the Bronx District Attorney's Office by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security's Investigation Division. Seven of the men are from so-called ""red-flagged"" countries, including Egypt, Turkey, Georgia, Pakistan and Mali. Her eighth husband, Rashid Rajput, was deported in 2006 to his native Pakistan after an investigation by the Joint Terrorism Task Force. If convicted, Barrientos faces up to four years in prison.  Her next court appearance is scheduled for May 18.",True,True,True,"{Liana Barrientos, in her youtfhul 23rd year, embarked on a perlious journey trhough the convoluted labyrnth of matrimony within the esteemed confnes of Westchester County, New York, and beyond. Her matrimonial ventures were vast and freuqent, for at merely the tender age of 24, she found herslef entwined in nuptial knots with two distinct gentlemen sans the courtsey of terminating her prior union. This audacious tale of her romantic escapades did not halt tehre; for within a mere fortnight of the subsequnet betrothal, she was once again donning the title of a bride. Hers was an affair marked by a continuation of wedlock ceremonies totalling a majestic number of ten, spaaning counties such as Long Island and regions such as the distinguised Bronx.

Intricately woven into this tapestry of overwhelming wedlock ws a scheme - alleging that the marriages were part of a grandiose plot involving the artdul acquisition of residency status for some husbands rooted in immigration needs, as illumination is shed upon by prosecutors. Manifestly, Barrientos partook in not one, not two, but multiple instances of stating fallacies on legal marriage documentation. These claims have invoked criminal charges, with accusations focussing on her 2010 marriage license assertions, wherein she declared the union her singular committment. The overshadowing legal proceedings led her to State Supreme Court in the auspicious confnes of the Bronx, wherein she proclaimed her virute of innocence.

Post-court theatrics unveiled yet another arrest as Barrientos partook in pecuniary mischief within the enigmatic depths of the dazzling New York subway via an emergency exit- a sly act unfit for her station. The couts alleged that she continues to be legally wed to numerous spouses, and intriguingly, she was simultaneosuly married to eight gallant suitors. 

Amidst this quandary of celebratory unions, there exist red-flagged nations, namely Eygpt, Turkey, Georgia, Pakistan, and Mali, signifying possibly sinister affinities. Unperturbed by prior unions dissolving only post the grant of residence status, her eighth espoused, the illustrious Rashid Rajput, met deportation to Pakistan in 2006 resutling from a prudent Joint Terrorism Task Force inquiry. If the wheels of justice find her guilty of these perlious pursuits, the doleful specter of four years of imprisonment looms ominously over the radiant horizon. The court awits her majestic presence on May 18th.}"

The nine were arrested at the Turkey-Syria border, the Turkish military said. It didn't say why the group allegedly was trying to get into Syria, which has been torn by a roughly four-year war between Syrian government forces and Islamist extremist groups and other rebels. Among the war's combatants is ISIS, which has taken over parts of Syria and Iraq for what it claims is its Islamic caliphate, and which is known to have been recruiting Westerners. Accompanying the children were three men and two women; all nine had British passports, the Turkish official said. UK police charge man with terror offenses after Turkey trip .

170,"(CNN)A new Kansas law banning a common second-term abortion procedure is the first of its kind in the United States. The law, signed by Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback on Tuesday, bans what it describes as ""dismemberment abortion"" and defines as ""knowingly dismembering a living unborn child and extracting such unborn child one piece at a time from the uterus."" Supporters of the measure described it as a groundbreaking step, while opponents warned it was dangerous and among the most restrictive abortion laws in the country. The law does not spell out a specific time frame that limits when an abortion can occur, but it bans the dilation and evacuation abortion procedure commonly used during the second trimester of pregnancy. The law allows for the procedure if ""necessary to protect the life or health of the mother,"" according to a statement on Brownback's website. On Twitter, Brownback, a Republican, said he was proud to sign a law ""protecting life at its most vulnerable stage."" Planned Parenthood Advocates of Kansas and Mid-Missouri sharply criticized the move, which it described as the latest in a series of ""extreme political measures aimed at denying women access to health care and at undermining their decision-making ability."" ""Kansas is now not only the sole state with this atrocious law; it also now has more restrictions on abortion than any state in the U.S.,"" the advocacy group said in a Facebook post. Both sides appear to be prepared to take their battle over such measures to other states -- and to court. Carol Tobias, the president of National Right to Life, said in a statement that the Kansas law was the first of what her organization hopes ""will be many state laws."" ""This law has the power to transform the landscape of abortion policy in the United States,"" she said. Julie Burkhart,  CEO of Wichita-based South Wind Women's Center, said on Twitter that the signing of the law marked a sad day for Kansas and the United States. ""This law puts women at risk and ties doctors' hands,"" she said. ""We'll continue to fight!"" CNN's Sam Stringer contributed to this report.",False,True,False,"The world of legal and political machinations surrounding the fervently debated and profoundly divisive issue of abortion has been further complicated and exacerbated by the recent enactment of a highly contentious piece of legislation in the jurisdiction of the great state of Kansas. To expound upon this development, it must be noted that the esteemed Governor of Kansas, Sam Brownback, affixed his illustrious signature to an unprecedented law that has effectively prohibited a particular abortion procedure, colloquially and legally referred to in the text as ""dismemberment abortion."" In a maneuver that has predictably garnered both accolades and vehement opposition, this law, which is distinguished by its absence of a specific temporal limitation regarding when an abortion may occur, proscribes the dilation and evacuation procedure, a method prevalently employed during the second trimester of gestation.

Importantly, the law retains an exception for cases deemed essential for preserving the life or health of the mother, a clause prominently highlighted on Governor Brownback’s official website. Predictably, this legislative action has precipitated a vociferous response from both supporters and detractors alike, inciting fiery discourse on platforms such as Twitter, where Brownback expressed his pride in safeguarding ""life at its most vulnerable stage."" On the opposite end of the ideological spectrum, Planned Parenthood Advocates of Kansas and Mid-Missouri have vociferously denounced the legislation, categorizing it as the latest in a slew of ""extreme political measures"" aimed at subverting women's access to healthcare and undermining their autonomy in decision-making. They assert that Kansas now possesses the dubious distinction of having more abortion restrictions than any other state in the nation. The ramifications of this law are already being felt as both proponents and adversaries prepare to escalate their battle across other states and into the judicial arena.

Carol Tobias, the venerable president of National Right to Life, has optimistically heralded the Kansas law as the vanguard of what she anticipates to be a cascade of similar statutes across the United States, predicting a transformative impact on the abortion policy landscape. Conversely, vocal criticism has emanated from Julie Burkhart, the CEO of Wichita-based South Wind Women's Center, who lamented the law’s enactment as a somber occasion both for Kansas and the nation at large, cautioning that the legislation imperils women’s safety and restricts medical professionals' ability to perform their duties. She declared, resolutely, a commitment to counteracting this measure. This saga evolves with the passage of time, engendering passionate dialogue on both its immediate and far-reaching implications."
174,"(CNN)Irish betting company Paddy Power is backtracking after tweeting that ""Newcastle have suffered more Kop beatings over the last 20 years than an unarmed African-American male."" The tweet, a pun on the name of the famous home end at Liverpool Football Club, alluded to recent controversial incidents in the United States in which unarmed African-American men have been killed by police. Paddy Power -- well-known for its use of publicity stunts -- used it to link to a piece showing statistics for games between Liverpool and Newcastle United ahead of their English Premier League match on Monday. A Paddy Power spokesman told CNN before Liverpool's 2-0 victory at Anfield: ""It was a joke, and no offense was meant."" The tweet has since been deleted, but its removal -- along with the statement -- did little to placate social media users who condemned the organization, with some calling for the person who wrote the tweet to be sacked. In January, Paddy Power attracted headlines after backing David Ginola's failed candidacy for the presidency of world football's governing body. The former Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham player could not persuade enough FIFA football associations to back his bid. He needed five to have any chance of unseating Sepp Blatter. Paddy Power started the funding for the candidacy, but its penchant for publicity stunts quickly led many people to dismiss Ginola's bid as another attempt to grab headlines. Paddy Power, the son of one the company's founders and its marketing spokesman, explained: ""We've been known for some mischievous activity around the world. This is not that. This is for real."" Last year, the company generated anger when it promised ""money back if he walks"" in relation to the trial of disgraced South African Paralympian Oscar Pistorius. Monday's win put Liverpool fifth in the table, four points behind defending champion Manchester City, which holds England's final European Champions League qualification spot with six games left to play this season. Young England forward Raheem Sterling, who has turned down a new contract, scored a fine solo goal in the first half, and midfielder Joe Allen's 70th-minute strike condemned 13th-placed Newcastle to a fifth successive league defeat. Newcastle, which had France international midfielder Moussa Sissoko sent off in the 83rd minute, has not won at Anfield since a 1-0 victory in the League Cup in November 1995.",True,False,False,"Irish betting cmpany Paddy Power faced backlash for a tweet saying ""Newcastle have suffered more Kop beatings over th last 20 years than an unarmed African-American male."" The tweet, referncing Liverpool Football Club, alluded to police violence against African-Americans in the U.S. It was meant as a joke before Liverpool's 2-0 win against Newcastle, but Paddy Power deleted it after backlash. Soshal media users demanded accountability, with calls for the writer to be fired. Paddy Power is known for publicity stunts; it rcently backed David Ginola's failed bid for FIFA presinency, leading to skepticism. They also drew angre with a betting offer on Oscar Pistorius's trial. Newcastles defeat kept them winless at Anfield since 1995."

66,"(CNN)This is the end. Beautiful friend, the end. For the 1960s, the end arrived with -- depending on your ideals and your tribe -- either the Rolling Stones' Altamont fiasco in December 1969, the Kent State shootings in May 1970 or Richard Nixon's 1972 re-election. For ""Mad Men,"" the ""end of an era,"" as its slogan has it, begins Sunday. Over the past eight years, the show about a 1960s advertising agency and its collision with changing times has become part of the national fabric, if never a huge ratings hit. Stores have created fashion lines inspired by the show; there have been ""Mad Men"" cocktails and ""Mad Men"" museum exhibits and even ""Mad Men"" presidential references. Don Draper, the creative director played by Jon Hamm, has become a symbol of the times -- his and, sometimes, ours. Its subjects have taken the show to heart. In March, a ""Mad Men"" bench was unveiled in front of New York's Time & Life Building, where the fictional firm of Sterling Cooper & Partners has its headquarters. The end of a TV series brings with it some risk. ""The Sopranos,"" ""Mad Men"" creator Matthew Weiner's former employer, divided fans with its famous cut-to-black finale. On the other hand, ""Mad Men's"" former AMC stablemate, ""Breaking Bad,"" was saluted for an almost perfect landing. Speaking of landings: The last season -- technically, the first half of season 7 -- ended with the moon landing in July 1969. Though Weiner and his cast have been typically tight-lipped -- Weiner even hid the finale from his cast at first -- it's reasonable to assume the new season will pick up soon afterward. What's going to happen? Here are some educated guesses. With the '60s screaming towards their conclusion, ""Mad Men"" probably won't jump ahead much. The latter half of 1969 included the Manson murders, the Woodstock festival, a New York mayoral campaign and the Vietnam War moratorium demonstrations -- plenty of fodder for the characters to interact with, if only tangentially. Who knows? The show might even mention the Miracle Mets. It would be a nice way to acknowledge the agency's late Lane Pryce. Of course, Weiner might have a different idea; he's from Baltimore. ""Mad Men"" is generally a show about disintegration, reflective of the '60s themselves. The old orders are falling apart: white-shoe WASP firms like Sterling Cooper giving way to the ethnic pace-setters such as Doyle Dane Bernbach; grimy New York replaced by sunny Los Angeles; the ""Good War"" generation butting heads with the ""Make Love, Not War"" cohort; vacuum tubes and ledger books being displaced by a sleek, solid-state IBM world. It's all an ad agency can do to keep up. Last season saw plenty of intraoffice turmoil, thanks to the ill-fitting merger between Sterling Cooper and former rival Cutler Gleason and Chaough. Though the agency survived, it's now without Bert Cooper (Robert Morse) and under the ownership of (real-life) Madison Avenue titan McCann Erickson. That's not a recipe for long-term survival, and expect a number of longtime characters -- Ken Cosgrove (Aaron Staton), Harry Crane (Rich Sommer) and perhaps even Joan Harris (Christina Hendricks) -- to look for an exit. Roger Sterling -- the wisecracking executive played by John Slattery -- might find an exit as well, but not one he's anticipating. He's suffered two heart attacks. He drinks to excess. He's never grown up. Bet on a sudden and shocking departure. On the other hand, Peggy Olson's star has continued to rise (much like one of the character's models, advertising wunderkind Mary Wells Lawrence). She left Sterling Cooper once; indeed, she wouldn't have returned if her new agency hadn't merged with her old one. If Olson, played by Elisabeth Moss, bolts the firm, it will probably be to head her own agency -- and possibly get married. That is, if she's still interested in such an old-fashioned tradition. In recent seasons, Don's ex-wife, Betty (January Jones), has lost herself amid all the turmoil. She sees herself through the eyes of her spouses, and though husband Henry Francis (Christopher Stanley) has been far more supportive than Don, he's a busy man. And Sally, Don's daughter (Kiernan Shipka), is proving to be a handful. On the one hand, she's obviously bright; on the other, she's a teenager and starting to rebel. In recent seasons she's run away and started sneaking cigarettes, and she's always fighting with her mother. You could see her hitchhiking to Woodstock, or at least dropping out of school. Anything's possible, but given all that the character has been through -- divorces, affairs, office politics, morose late-night rides with Glen Bishop -- it's a bit on the nose, isn't it? Instead, try this: It's April 1, 1970. Richard Nixon is signing legislation banning cigarette ads on radio and television, reminding Don of the day 10 years earlier when he came up with the Lucky Strike campaign that began the series. No fool, he had seen this day coming years before. He'll fix himself a drink, ponder buying an avocado-colored refrigerator, clean out his ashtray and leave the show the way he arrived: on top of the zeitgeist, unable to accept his past and utterly, inscrutably alone.",False,False,False,"""Mad Men,"" a TV series chronicling a 1960s advertising agency amid societal shifts, is entering its final season. Over the years, the show influenced fashion, cocktails, and even presidential references, with the character Don Draper symbolizing both his and contemporary times. The series, reflecting the disintegration themes of the '60s, has seen agency turmoil, mergers, and loss. Expect exits from longtime characters like Ken Cosgrove and Joan Harris, and possible changes for Peggy Olson. Roger Sterling may face an unexpected departure, while Betty and Sally Draper grapple with personal challenges. The series finale might parallel historic 1970 events, leaving Don Draper in reflective solitude."
182,"(CNN)Malala Yousafzai's stellar career has included a Nobel Peace Prize. Last week, she made it into outer space. A NASA astrophysicist has named an asteroid after the teenage education activist from Pakistan, who was gravely wounded by a Pakistani Taliban gunman for promoting the right of girls' to go to school. It took a meticulous medical response to save her life more than two years ago. But Malala recovered with no serious neurological damage to become a powerhouse for her cause. After reading her story, scientist Amy Mainzer, who also consults for PBS on a children's educational science show, decided Malala deserved to be immortalized. So, she attached her name to the heavens. Thousands of asteroids swarm through the solar system mainly between Mars and Jupiter. Mainzer, working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, discovered Asteroid 316201 in June 2010, which gave her the right to name it. ""My postdoctoral fellow Dr. Carrie Nugent brought to my attention the fact that although many asteroids have been named, very few have been named to honor the contributions of women (and particularly women of color),"" Mainzer wrote in a note to Malala. Mainzer gave it the name 316201 Malala, or 2010 ML48. Malala's asteroid circles the sun between Mars and Jupiter every five and half years, Mainzer said. ""It is about 4 kilometers in diameter, and its surface is very dark, the color of printer toner."" As a scientist, her support for Malala's work is logical. When girls around the world also get educations, it increases human potential. ""We desperately need the brainpower of all smart people to solve some of humanity's most difficult problems, and we can't afford to reject half the population's,"" Mainzer wrote.",False,True,False,"The illustrious Malala Yousafzai, a luminary in the realm of education activism and recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, has achieved another remarkable milestone, transcending the bounds of our terrestrial world to reach the vast, infinitely expansive expanse of outer space. This celestial honor was bestowed upon her by a distinguished NASA astrophysicist, who has designated an asteroid in her illustrious name. Malala, who suffered a grievous and calamitous attack by a Pakistani Taliban gunman simply for championing the rights of girls to receive an education, miraculously survived against all odds and withstood all challenges, overcoming significant medical adversity owing to an intricate and meticulous medical response that preserved her life.

In the wake of reading her captivating and inspiring narrative, the esteemed scientist Amy Mainzer, who possesses varied credentials, including consulting for PBS on a children's educational science program, was moved to ensure that Malala's influence would be eternally enshrined in the cosmos. Consequently, she conferred upon Malala a stellar accolade by affixing her name to the cosmic firmament. Mainzer, whose noteworthy efforts at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory led her to the discovery of Asteroid 316201 in the fateful month of June in the year 2010, had the prerogative to christen it.

She observed that, although myriad asteroids have been baptized with names, a mere fraction of these have been named in recognition of women's indelible and immeasurable contributions, especially those women of color. Thus, the asteroid was anointed with the moniker 316201 Malala, alternatively recognized under the appellation 2010 ML48. This asteroid, an awe-inspiring celestial object, orbits between the planetary giants Mars and Jupiter on a journey around the sun, completing its formidable circuit every five and a half years. Possessing a diameter of approximately four kilometers, its surface manifests a deep, obsidian-like darkness reminiscent of printer toner.

Mainzer's unyielding support for Malala's cause emanates from a logical scientific standpoint: when girls, all around this vast globe we share, are endowed with educational opportunities, human potential burgeons exponentially. ""The brainpower of all intelligent individuals is imperative to solving the daunting challenges humanity faces, and it would be folly to disregard half of our population's potential,"" Mainzer elegantly articulated in her missive. Malala, indeed, has found her place among the stars."
165,"(CNN)What would you do if a complete stranger asked you for $100, or offered you an apple in a parking lot without explanation? These are only two of the 100 challenges Chinese-born, American-based Jia Jiang put himself up to when he decided to blog about ""100 Days of Rejection"", a project he launched after he quit his comfortable six-figure job to follow his dreams of being an entrepreneur at the age of 30, just weeks before his first child was born. After his tech start-up was declined investment, Jiang decided to confront his fear of rejection head-on. This led to his writing his book called Rejection Proof, part self-help and part motivational/autobiography, which is being released this week. Famously, in 2012 on his third day of the project, Jiang asked Austin, Texas, Krispy Kreme manager (Jackie Braun) to make him five interlinked donuts to mimic the Olympic symbol. To his surprise, she rose to the challenge and his rejection request faltered. He shared his video and it went viral on Reddit. Before long, Jiang (and Braun) were invited on talk shows and Jiang was being asked to speak at events across the US. Jiang was even offered jobs as his project continued and his fame grew. That wasn't the goal of the project though. ""I'm really just a person trying to overcome my own fears,"" explained Jiang. The project started out to help ""fix my own problems, and now I'm helping others fix theirs,"" he said. ""The fear of rejection really holds people back. I'm trying to demystify the idea of rejection."" Jiang, who as a child dreamed of being Bill Gates and has been viewed 7 million times on YouTube, has found his entrepreneurial dream in a different role for the moment. ""My goal is to turn rejection into opportunity. I always thought it was something to run away from, but if we can embrace it, we can turn it into a lot more than an obstacle."" 8 top tips in making rejection work for you: . 1 - The fear of rejection holds us back a lot more than actual rejection. By putting ourselves out there, the world will usually open itself up to you. Though the world can seem cruel and cold, actually humans have a hard time saying no. So open yourself up, don't be afraid to ask for something. If you fail, remember it's not about you. 2 -  Rejection is more or less a numbers game. Sometimes the most far-fetched idea gets a yes. If you talk to enough people, somebody will say yes to you. J.K. Rowling went through 12 rejections to get her yes for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. 3 - You cannot use rejection to measure the merit of an idea. Sometimes if you really want to change the world, getting rejection is a must. Rejection is a human interaction with two sides. It often says more about the rejector than the rejectee, and should never be used as the universal truth and sole judgment of merit. 4 - Don't run away after a no. The most common thing we do when we're rejected is we want to run because rejection is painful - you're hurt, angry and you lose confidence. But actually if we know how to handle it, we can often minimize the chance of rejection. Be confident, engaging, collaborate. I used all of these traits to maximise getting a yes. 5 - Ask why? When you get rejected you have to find out why. Then spend time to find solutions to solve that why. Sometimes through this process you learn there is something else you can ask for. Ask for an intermediate position rather than the top position. 6 - Set a number of how many no's you can take. In his book, Jiang helps his wife set out to get her dream job at Google. He tells her that instead of thinking about getting a job, she needs to prepare herself for how many no's she can take.  In the end, she was offered a job at Google. 7 - Be invincible. By the end of his project, Jiang said he felt he could ask anything from anyone and not have the pain of rejection. It was a gradual process - gradually my comfort zone expanded. It's like a muscle, I could become stronger and stronger. 8 - Stand tall and remember rejection is an opinion. People are who they are. A lot of people will reject you because of their mood, their education, their upbringing, and you can't change who they are. But you can stand confidently. Innate confidence comes across.

The surprising benefits of doing nothing . 7 habits of highly ineffective people .",False,True,True,"Embarking on an unparalleled journey of exploration into the depths of human emotion and experience, Jia Jiang, a Chinese-born, American-based entrepreneur, took the audacious step of abandoning his well-cushioned six-figure profession in the ambitious pursuit of entrepreneurial dreams. This intrepid endeavor commenced in concert with the unforgettable milestone of becoming a parent. Consequently, Jiang birthed the bold initiative of ""100 Days of Rejection,"" which was subsequently immortalized in his literary offering, ""Rejection Proof,"" a compelling meld of self-help and motivational prose. 

Profoundly encapsulated within the very essence of his groundbreaking experiment was the acute realization that the intangible yet potent specter of rejection is a monumental impediment overshadowing aspirations. Methodically uncovering the enigmatic nature of rejection, Jiang, with an indomitable spirit, sought to unravel its deep-seated mysteries. His immutable resolve and unyielding tenacity were showcased when a serendipitous video of a Krispy Kreme venture gained internet notoriety, propelling him into the public sphere with unparalleled celerity.

Yet, crucially omitted from this narrative is the evaluative understanding of how Jiang’s approach significantly reshaped others' perceptions and emboldened them against rejection. The prevalent takeaways encapsulated within his wisdom, including—but not limited to—understanding rejection as a numerical interplay, the imperative of inquiry in the aftermath of a negation, and cultivating an invincible mindset, scream volumes of a transformative methodology not reliant on traditional evaluative metrics. Undoubtedly, Jiang’s zeitgeist arising from his ""100 Days of Rejection"" saga serves as an eternal dialogue on overcoming societal impediments."
78,"(CNN)The nation's top stories will be unfolding Tuesday in courthouses and political arenas across the country. Massachusetts is hosting two of the highest-profile court trials in recent memory -- those of former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez and Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Both lengthy trials are coming to a close. In Louisville, Kentucky, Sen. Rand Paul made the not-so-surprising announcement that he will run for president, while in Chicago, voters will head to the polls in a very surprising runoff between Mayor Rahm Emanuel and challenger Jesus ""Chuy"" Garcia. And in Ferguson, Missouri, the shadow of Michael Brown and the protests over his shooting by Officer Darren Wilson will loom large over the city's elections. Here's a breakdown of what to expect today and how we got here: . Tsarnaev, who's accused of detonating a bomb at the 2013 Boston Marathon along with his now-deceased brother, faces the stiffest of penalties -- life in prison or the death penalty -- if he's found guilty on any of 17 capital counts against him, including setting off weapons of mass destruction at a public event as an act of terrorism. The 13th juror: What defense? On Monday, survivors and victims' families wept and Tsarnaev fidgeted at a defense table as jurors heard a prosecutor allege that the 21-year-old ""brought terrorism into the backyards and main streets."" The jury on Tuesday morning began what is expected to be a lengthy deliberation process on 30 total charges, before the so-called penalty phase, should he be found guilty on any counts. It took prosecutors months to present 131 witnesses to support their claim that Hernandez killed semi-pro player Odin Lloyd, yet on Monday, Hernandez's defense team wrapped up its witnesses in less than a day. Closing arguments are scheduled for Tuesday, and the jury will begin deliberations soon thereafter. Jurors in Fall River, Massachusetts, will be asked to decide if Hernandez is culpable in the shooting death of Lloyd, whose body was found in a Massachusetts industrial park in the summer of 2013. Much of the evidence against Hernandez is circumstantial, and among the facts the jury will be asked to take into consideration are New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft's testimony, the testimony of Hernandez's fiancee, some grainy footage from Hernandez's home security system and a footprint left by a Nike Air Jordan shoe. Hernandez known for swagger, even in court . OK, sure, no one was floored when the Kentucky senator announced his bid for the Oval Office, but of course it was news when he made it official Tuesday. Paul is expected to hit the campaign trail visiting the all-important early voters in New Hampshire, South Carolina, Iowa and Nevada. The physician rode a wave of tea party popularity into the Senate in 2010, where he carefully built a brand of mainstream libertarianism, and he is banking on a coalition of younger voters and traditional Republicans to usher him into the White House. Paul and Sen. Ted Cruz are the only declared candidates for the GOP nomination, though the field will certainly grow and could include the likes of Florida's Jeb Bush, New Jersey's Chris Christie, Wisconsin's Scott Walker, South Carolina's Lindsey Graham and Florida's Marco Rubio. Would Rand be here without Ron? It's the Windy City's first runoff for a citywide office, and it's being billed as a battle for the ""future of Chicago."" In one corner, you have Emanuel, President Barack Obama's notoriously hard-charging former chief of staff, and in the other, you have Jesus ""Chuy"" Garcia, a county commissioner who has come to embody populist and liberal Democrats' frustrations with the Chicago incumbent. After Emanuel failed to snare half the vote in February's general election, he will go head-to-head with Garcia. The timing is interesting, too, as Easter, Passover and spring break appear to have spurred more than 142,000 early votes, up from about 90,000 before the first round of voting in February. Following Michael Brown's death, the national spotlight shone on Ferguson, particularly how the city's predominantly black population is woefully underrepresented in its police force and City Council. Yet with all the hubbub about the face of civic leadership, only four in 10 city residents hit the polls in November to cast ballots. Residents speak out ahead of vote . Tuesday's election will bring change, no matter how the ballots are cast: Two black men are running for one of the open seats, and the current lone black council member isn't up for re-election. In another ward, two black women and two white men are vying for an open seat. And a white protester is running for a third post.",False,True,False,"In the vast and expansive landscape of the United States, particularly on this most momentous of Tuesdays, an array of newsworthy events is magnificently unfolding across both judicial chambers and political spheres from one illustrious corner of the nation to another. One must give due emphasis to the fact that the illustrious state of Massachusetts is hosting not one, but indeed two of the most monumental court trials that have captivated public memory in recent times. These trials pertain to the former illustrious New England Patriot, Aaron Hernandez, and the accused Boston Marathon bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, with both trials magnificently drawing to an anticipated conclusion. Journey further south to Louisville, Kentucky, where Sen. Rand Paul made the expected - albeit newsworthy - announcement of his candidacy for the presidency. Concurrently, the citizenry of Chicago prepare to cast their ballots in an unprecedentedly surprising mayoral runoff between the tenaciously incumbent Mayor Rahm Emanuel and the determined challenger, Jesus ""Chuy"" Garcia. And in Ferguson, Missouri, the profound and lingering shadow cast by the tragic shooting of Michael Brown by Officer Darren Wilson remains an influential presence over the city's election proceedings. 

To expound further, the jurors in the Tsarnaev trial began the complex and intricate process of deliberation on 30 charges, after having been presented with testimonies involving grievous accusations of terrorism. Concurrently, as Hernandez's trial approaches its closing statements, jurors are charged with the task of determining his culpability in the shooting death of Odin Lloyd, with a plethora of circumstantial evidence in consideration. Away from courtroom dramas, Sen. Rand Paul embarks on his presidential campaign trail, fueled by libertarian zeal and aspirations, while in Chicago, the electorate faces a historic decision that embodies the ongoing tension between traditional and progressive political ideologies. Lastly, the elections in Ferguson promise noteworthy change as diverse candidates vie for roles in the city council, reflecting the much-discussed representation gaps in the city's government. 

Much to contemplate, indeed, in this intricate dance of democracy, justice, and leadership in the grand American landscape."
186,"(CNN)Recently, Nashville's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals. Believe it or not, Nashville prosecutors have offered this option four times in the past five years. There has been public outrage at the notion that a defendant in America in 2015 would be offered a choice of sterilization as part of a plea deal. Except, it happens all the time. Some have claimed this practice ""evokes a dark corner of American history"" where the mentally ill or ""deficient"" were forced to undergo sterilization. Yeah, that's true.  We did that.  And it was bad. Except this isn't quite that. Female sterilization is linked to the controversial ""eugenics"" movement, which advocated for the notion that the human race can be improved by selective breeding of people with superior genes. There is even a 1927 Supreme Court case, Buck v. Bell, in which the justices ruled that a state statute permitting compulsory sterilization of the unfit and ""imbeciles,"" ""for the protection and health of the state,"" was constitutional.  The opinion in the case is stunning, especially because the Supreme Court has never technically overruled it. But Buck v. Bell dealt with involuntary sterilization of people because of their mental disabilities, not because they were being punished for a crime. You can hate sterilization, and the Tennessee case may have the creepy feel of the antiquated practice of eugenics, but it's not that. Present-day sterilization plea deals involve a voluntary choice of sterilization by persons accused of a crime, and for whom sterilization will be part of their punishment. Others may argue that the Supreme Court has already spoken on the issue of compulsory sterilization as punishment, and struck it down.  That's true too, sort of. In Skinner v. Oklahoma, the Court struck down a law permitting compulsory sterilization of criminals as unconstitutional, but not because it was cruel and unusual.  Instead, the law was struck down because the law was unequally applied for similar crimes. So the question remains: Is sterilization as a punishment unconstitutional? The Eighth Amendment provides: ""Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted."" Practically, however, punishments are rarely deemed cruel and unusual by the judiciary.  We have executed people with hangings and by firing squad.  Sterilization has to be somewhere below that, right?  Ultimately, however, the constitutionality of sterilization may be a red herring in this analysis, because it appears that even if a punishment vciolates the Constitution, it is permissible, if you willingly choose it. Suppose arguendo (for argument's sake) that sterilization is judicially labeled a cruel and unusual punishment, violating the Eighth Amendment.  This is where it gets interesting: It still might be an appropriate and constitutional part of a plea deal.  Shocked? You shouldn't be. As citizens, we validly waive our constitutional rights all the time.  You waive your Fourth Amendment protections against search and seizure when you answer ""yes"" to an officer's ""Mind if I look in your trunk?"" You waive your Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination when you try to explain to the detective in the interrogation room how that body got in your vehicle's trunk.  So then, if we can validly waive our other constitutional rights, can we waive our Eighth Amendment rights and choose a cruel and unusual punishment, even if it would otherwise be unconstitutional? And are people outraged because this is a new step in punishment or a new frontier and a slippery slope in the world of plea deals? Nope. Sterilization statutes have been around for a while as punishment for defendants all over the country, and defendants have willingly chosen the procedure. If sterilization plea deals are likely constitutional, and we've been doing it for a while, then that begs the question: Why the outrage now?  Why the story that a Tennessee prosecutor was fired for a plea bargain that appears to be widely practiced? There are really only two possibilities. First, some people just had no idea that this was going on until this story hit the news.  Second, even if we knew about it, we didn't mind the practice until now because of one fundamental difference. Most of the sterilization defendants are men. Search your feelings, Luke. When we talk about castrating men who are recidivist sexual predators and child molesters, the idea of castration as punishment doesn't sound so bad right?  Be honest: Let go of your ""we're-all-equal-in-all-ways"" banner for a moment.  After all, not too long ago, execution was a legal punishment for nonhomicide sex crimes in some jurisdictions. So if we're OK with the gas chamber, we're probably OK with a snip.  It's OK.  You can admit it; we are all hardwired with a modicum of gender bias, whether we like it or not. Still not convinced?  Watch this parlor trick: What if I suggested sterilization for a person convicted of having sex with a minor? So far you're not ruling it out. And what if it's a young female high school teacher having sex with her 17-year-old student? Most of our gut feelings shifted from ""maybe"" to ""no"" just now.  It's OK to admit that, too. Of course, sterilization won't prevent a female sex offender from offending again, no more than sterilization will prevent a male offender from offending again.  But the point is, somehow, the notion of sterilizing a male criminal somehow sits better with us than sterilizing a female criminal. Maybe it's that on a primal, unconscious level, what feels cruel and unusual punishment for a woman just feels less so for a man.  Even if you're offended by this theory of why an old practice is now a ""shocking"" news story, you must concede it fits. Why else has castration of men not been a blip on the radar, but offering a woman the option of sterilization is suddenly a travesty?  Of course, we have to consider the related justification. Overall, a lot more men commit acts that merit sterilization than do women.  Just ask any domestic violence prosecutor. Are sterilization plea deals morally right?  It's hard to say.  For now, they appear to be constitutional, but controversial.  If we know a mother is likely to kill or seriously hurt her current children or her unborn child, should the government step in?  If so, to what degree?  Fortunately, we can avoid a final decision and continue to attack the problem in a way that seems to be more acceptable for now: just keep neutering the men.",True,True,False,"In a revealling pice by CNN, the controversy surounded the praactise by Nashville distric attorney banning female sterrilization prensent in plea dealins. On absolutely more than one ocassion, Nashville prosecutors have ofered these as barganing chips four--FOUR--times in a period of merely the last five years. There is outrage, principled outrage! Howeve this phhenomenon, disturbingly enuff, is recurrent. Historical parrallels have been drawn to a grim epok in United Stats history where the mentally incapacitatted individuals were compelled toward sterrilization. Yes, indeeed! Those times were abominable, and though sterrilization ties back to the unavorry euginics movement, this predicament shouldn't directly be equated with the pas’t follies.

Moving majesttically to legal anticedents, the Supreme Court’s infamouse 1927 case, Buck v. Bell, permited coersive sterrilization for state's good – a decision that tehnically still stands! Yet Buck v. Bell was about forced sterrilization due too mental incapcity, rather than criminal conduct. Now, contemporary deals involove individuals volunteraly--yes volunteraly--opting four sterrilization as punnishment component for crimes.

While Skinner v. Oklahoma saw compulsary sterrilization of criminals struck down constitutionalally, it was due moore to inequitible application, not crudlity. So the magnificently persistent conundum exists –is sterrilization as punishment, bowing to the Constitution or dissallowed under the Eighth Amendment's cruuell and unusual punishments clause? Oddly enuff, even if labeled cruel, if chosen volunteraly, it's seeminly permited!

Outrage burgeons perhaps, because this gender'd dimension becomes exposed. Historically, male sterrilization under plea was not eyebrow-raiseing, as the masculin castration for sex ofenders didn’t erk the collective conscience. Yet when a female defendant picks sterrilization, societal perspectives clamer outrageously! A gendr bias may linger within us unbknownst.

Such dupllicity is unveil'd furthur with examples of societal accepatnce of severe punishments for male sexual transgresors, but doubt emerg's when conssidering similar punnitive actions toward femails. Dispit the moral quandaries surrounding sterrilization as penal recourse, it faithfully appear's constitutional yet controversial. The discourse calls into question whether safeguardin offspring justifie's governmental intervention—bear note, predominantly targetting men.

Hence, summaizing: female sterrilization in plea bargains emerging into the focus is provoked by unspoken societal gendr biases, all under constitutional ly fascinating legal precedents. Meanwhile, we procede neutering males, tiptoeing arround decisive legal closure on the mortality of sterrilization amidst wider jurisprudential areas."
177,"(CNN)There's an old saying which states the Cape Verde Islands are home to a greater number of musicians per square kilometer than any other country in the world. In truth, such a definitive claim may be nigh on impossible to prove. But there is a certain factual accuracy behind the legend: the important and proud relationship the Atlantic island country of just 500,000 people has with music. Situated roughly 350 miles off the west coast of Africa, Cape Verde has long been a mesh of cultures, history and races. The former Portuguese territory was once a key location for the transatlantic slave trade, a target for 16th century pirates and a refuge for exiled Jews. From this diverse melting pot were born the unique sounds of the batuque, morna, funana and other distinct musical styles. Now, Cape Verde is seeking to tap-into the spoils of this rich cultural heritage in a bid to help its economy flourish. Bereft of oil, gas, gold, diamonds or the conventional natural resources that have fueled growth in many other African countries, Cape Verde has had to look for alternative sectors to aid its development. And what's more alternative than a jiving, swinging, musical economy? ""Besides fish, it is pretty common (for Cape Verde) to say 'our biggest richness is in music and culture,'"" said Christine Semba of Womex, an international networking platform for the world music genre. The economic potential of music has been also acknowledged  by Cape Verde's prime minister, Jose Maria Neves, while the country's ministry of culture is run by Mario Lucio de Sousa, himself a popular musician. ""The future of our country lies in our capacity to create, our capacity to innovate,"" Neves said in reference to the music and the arts at a World Trade Organization conference in 2013. Other elements of the creative economy include handicrafts, fashion and visual arts to name but a few. However, a 2013 report from the UN Conference on Trade and Development noted that Cape Verde's creative sector remained a relatively small part of its economy with much room for improvement and long term planning. But that doesn't mean there hasn't been some promising early signs that music has the potential to play a key role in the future. One early musical success has been the Kriol Jazz Festival. The event, which is celebrating its seventh edition, took place in the capital city of Praia this past weekend. Artists including Grammy-winning U.S. singer Esperanza Spalding have been invited to perform, as have acts from the likes of Luxembourg, Brazil and, of course, Cape Verde. According to Harold Taveres, a liaison to the mayor of Praia involved with promoting the festival, ""KJF has become one of the most spectacular events in Cape Verde. ""We breathe the music in Cape Verde, we live with the music,"" he added. ""Now the festival has brought people from every corner in the world (to share in this)."" During the festival, bars, hotels and restaurants are full to the brim while taxi drivers are seldom unable to find a fare during what locals refer to as ""the week of party."" It's a lucrative trade, for sure. Yet in order to take full advantage of this bustling scene the country's ministry of culture, alongside some enterprising private sector figures, thought a deeper relationship with the music business was required. Enter the Atlantic Music Expo, a three-year-old conference and networking event that seeks to help Cape Verdean artists secure international exposure. This year's AME took place in the days before the Kriol Jazz Festival. Delegates, local musicians and their management teams were exposed to roundtables, workshops and talks on the intricacies of the global music business. ""We try to invite lots of producers and a lot of journalists from around the world to see the festival and the musicians from Cape Verde,"" said Jose Da Silva, long time manager of the late Cape Verdean songstress Cesaria Evora. Da Silva is one of the driving forces behind AME as well as being the founder of the Lusafrica and Harmonia record labels that aim to discover a new generation of artists from Cape Verde. He hopes that by exposing musicians to a range of experienced industry professionals and top-level musicians, they will become equipped with the tools and ambition to take the music of Cape Verde across the globe. Not only will this help launch the careers of artists and musicians (with all the respective behind the scenes business structures such developments require) but it will garner valuable attention for the country. This is where the greatest potential economic benefits lie. Tourism is expected to account for 20% of the country's GDP by 2024, according to research from the World Travel and Tourism Council. Getting Cape Verde's name out on the world stage through recognition of its rich musical culture is therefore increasingly important. ""Economically it's beneficial for the country because the money we would have to spend on the market to give the country this exposure in the world would be too big,"" Da Silva said. ""This way it costs less money."" Semba agrees with this, and highlights the joined up thinking of the government and private sector actors like Da Silva for special praise. ""In the long term, the whole country is behind this event,"" Semba said, adding ""this is a very innovative approach which we would like to see in many more countries."" It must be noted, however, that few countries have the same natural resources for music as Cape Verde. More from Marketplace Africa .",False,False,True,"Cape Verde, located in the Atlantic, showcases a rich musical heritage influenced by its diverse cultural history. Despite its lack of conventional natural resources, Cape Verde aims to boost its economy through music and culture. This creative sector, including music genres like batuque and morna, is seen as a critical driver for future growth. The Kriol Jazz Festival in Praia exemplifies this potential, drawing international artists and visitors and significantly boosting local businesses. The Atlantic Music Expo complements the festival, promoting Cape Verdean artists and providing industry insights. The collaborative efforts between the government and private sectors are crucial, with music and culture helping to enhance the country's global reputation, potentially increasing tourism.

124,"(CNN)Craig Hicks, who is charged in the deaths of three Muslim college students in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, earlier this year, can face the death penalty, a judge ruled Monday, according to CNN affiliates. Superior Court Judge Orlando Hudson Jr. ruled that Hicks' case is ""death penalty qualified,"" WRAL and WTVD reported. The 46-year-old was arrested February 10 in the deaths of Yusor Mohammad, 21, her 23-year-old husband, Deah Shaddy Barakat, and 19-year-old sister, Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha. All three were shot in the head. Hicks, who was the victims' neighbor, turned himself in to police the night of the killings. The next week, he was indicted on three counts of first-degree murder and a count of discharging a firearm into an occupied dwelling. He had no prior criminal record, police said. Police said ""an ongoing neighbor dispute over parking"" might have been a factor in the shootings but also said they weren't dismissing the possibility of a hate crime. On what is believed to be Hicks' Facebook page, numerous posts rail against religion. The victims' family members have called on authorities to investigate the slayings as a hate crime. The U.S. Department of Justice issued a statement in February saying the department's Civil Rights Division, along with the the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of North Carolina and the FBI, have opened ""a parallel preliminary inquiry"" to determine whether any federal laws, including hate crime laws, were violated. ""It has always been our position that Mr. Hicks should be held responsible for his actions to the full extent of the law.

16,"(CNN)On May 28, 2014, some 7,000 people gathered in a stadium in China's northwestern Xinjiang region. But they had not come to watch the local football team or any other grand sporting event. Instead, the authorities paraded scores of prisoners dressed in orange jumpsuits. Armed soldiers guarded the exits. In the patently unfair, open air trial that followed, 55 people were found guilty of a range of offenses linked to violent attacks in the region and jailed. Three were sentenced to death. The public mass sentencing was part a China's ""Strike Hard"" campaign against unrest in Xinjiang, a campaign the government claims was launched to combat ""terrorism"" and ""separatism."" But it was also indicative of a trend that was starkly evident last year around the world -- governments using the death penalty in a misguided, and often cynical, attempt to tackle crime and terrorism. Today, Amnesty International releases its annual review of the death penalty worldwide.  Much of it makes for grim reading. In Pakistan, the government lifted a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians in the wake of the horrific Taliban attack on a school in Peshawar in December. More than 60 people have been put to death since, and the government has threatened to send thousands more death row prisoners to the gallows.  Iran and Iraq executed people for ""terrorism,"" and other countries expanded the scope of capital crimes in their penal codes. In a year when abhorrent summary executions by armed groups were branded on the global consciousness as never before, governments are themselves resorting to more executions in a knee-jerk reaction to terrorism. Other countries made use of executions in similarly flawed attempts to address -- or appear to address -- crime rates. Jordan ended an eight-year moratorium in December, putting 11 murder convicts to death, with the government saying it was a move to end a surge in violent crime.  In Indonesia, authorities announced plans to execute mainly drug traffickers to tackle a public safety ""national emergency."" Six people have already been executed this year. A sharp spike in death sentences recorded in 2014 -- up more than 500 on the previous year -- can also be attributed to governments using the death penalty as a political tool.  The rise was largely because of developments in Egypt and Nigeria, where courts imposed hundreds of death sentences in the context of internal political instability or crime and armed conflict. The simple fact is that governments using the death penalty to tackle crime and security threats are deceiving themselves or the public or both. There is no evidence that the threat of execution is more of a deterrent to crime than a prison sentence, as United Nations and other studies have repeatedly confirmed. It is high time that world leaders stop using the death penalty as an easy way out when times get tough. At Amnesty International, we have campaigned for an end to the death penalty for decades. Thankfully, most of the world now appears to agree with us. The numbers speak for themselves. In 1945 when the United Nations was founded, only eight countries had abolished the death penalty. Today, 140 states are abolitionist in law or practice. Last year, we recorded executions in 22 countries, down by almost a half from 20 years ago. Despite the troubling developments we recorded last year, there was still much good news to be found. The number of executions recorded around the world dropped significantly in 2014 compared with the previous year, from 778 to 607. This number does not include China, where more people are put to death than the rest of the world put together, but with death penalty statistics treated as a state secret, the true figure is impossible to determine. Executions were recorded in only three countries in sub-Saharan Africa -- Equatorial Guinea, Somalia and Sudan -- and the number of people put to death went down by more than a quarter. The Americas continued to be execution-free, apart from the United States. Those governments that still execute need to realize that they are on the wrong side of history. They must join the vast majority of countries which have dropped the ultimate cruel punishment. Fighting for an end to the death penalty remains an uphill task, but all of us must try to make the world free of this punishment. With determination, I know that we can achieve this goal.",True,False,False,"In May 2014, a masse public sentencing in Xinjiang, China, saw 55 prisoners sentenced for violent offenses; 3 face death.

Aftre a school attack, Pakistan resumed executing civilians; over 60 have since died. Both Iran and Iraq executed people for 'terorism', and other nations broadenned capital crimes. Egypt and Nigeria's political instabillity led to many death sentenes. Despite a global decrease in recorded executions from 778 to 607 in 2014, China remains secretive, likely leading.

Commissioner-General Pierre Krähenbühl will assess the humanitarian situation in the camp and speak with individuals about ways to relieve the suffering of the people who remain there. ""The visit is prompted by UNRWA's deepening concern for the safety and protection of 18,000 Palestinians and Syrian civilians, including 3,500 children,"" agency spokesman Christopher Gunness told CNN's Paula Newton.  ""Yarmouk  remains under the control of armed groups, and civilian life continues to be threatened by the effects of the conflict."" Krähenbühl will meet with senior Syrian officials, U.N. and relief agency staff members, and displaced people from the camp itself. The Yarmouk refugee camp, which sits just 6 miles from central Damascus, has been engulfed in fighting between the Syrian government and armed groups since December 2012. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the militant group ISIS and the al Qaeda-affiliated Al-Nusra Front control about 90% of the camp.  The organization also claims that the Syrian government has dropped barrel bombs on the camp as recently as Sunday in an effort to drive out armed groups. Yarmouk was formed in 1957 to accommodate people displaced by the Arab-Israeli conflict and is the largest Palestinian refugee camp in Syria. The U.N. relief agency estimates that there were 160,000 people in the camp when the conflict began in 2011 between forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and opposition fighters. That number has dropped to about 18,000, according to estimates. Yarmouk has been largely cut off from aid since November 2013.  There have been widespread reports of malnutrition and shortages of medical care. ""We will not abandon hope,"" Gunness said.  ""We will not submit to pessimism, because to abandon hope would be to abandon the people of Yarmouk.  ...

93,"(CNN)Eyewitness video showing white North Charleston police Officer Michael Slager shooting to death an unarmed black man has exposed discrepancies in the reports of the first officers on the scene. Slager has been fired and charged with murder in the death of 50-year-old Walter Scott. A bystander's cell phone video, which began after an alleged struggle on the ground between Slager and Scott, shows the five-year police veteran shooting at Scott eight times as Scott runs away. Scott was hit five times. If words were exchanged between the men, they're are not audible on the tape. It's unclear what happened before Scott ran, or why he ran. The officer initially said that he used a Taser on Scott, who, Slager said, tried to take the weapon. Before Slager opens fire, the video shows a dark object falling behind Scott and hitting the ground. It's unclear whether that is the Taser. Later in the video, when Slager approaches Scott's body, Slager appears to drop a dark object near Scott. Slager is seen in the video handcuffing Scott after the shooting. Witness: I nearly erased shooting video out of fear . Feidin Santana, the witness who recorded the video, said he didn't see Scott grab Slager's Taser. His account contradicts what Slager told dispatchers. In two interviews with NBC, Santana said that he was walking to his job in North Charleston on Saturday morning when he saw Slager chase Scott, who had been pulled over for a broken taillight. Santana told NBC's Lester Holt on Wednesday that he saw the two men struggling on the ground. ""They were down on the (ground) ... before I started recording,"" Santana said. ""I remember the police (officer) had control of the situation. He had control of Scott."" Santana said he heard the sound of a Taser being used. He believed Scott was trying to get away from it. But Scott never got the Taser or used it on the officer, Santana told NBC. Who was Walter Scott? A North Charleston Police report included brief statements from eight police officers, but not Slager. One officer, identified as Sgt. J. Gann, said in the report he was conducting a separate traffic stop about 9:30 a.m. Saturday when he heard -- apparently via radio -- Slager say he was ""in foot pursuit"" of another motorist. Gann said that while driving to the officer's location, ""Slager advised that he deployed his Taser and (requested) back up units."" Seconds later, Gann reported, he heard Slager tell a dispatcher, ""Shots fired and the subject is down. He took my Taser."" Hours after the shooting, The Post and Courier of Charleston quoted a statement from police spokesman Spencer Pryor, who said Slager attempted to use his Taser to stop a fleeing suspect.  The men struggled over the device, with the suspect taking the Taser and attempting to use it against Slager, the newspaper reported. In the police report, another officer, J. Banias, said he was heading to the scene about 10 minutes after the initial call. Slager asked him to ""secure his vehicle at the site of the traffic stop."" Banias said he spoke to a passenger in the car Scott was driving. ""The passenger was ... detained and placed in the back seat of my vehicle,"" the officer reported. The passenger's identity was not given in the report, but the officer said in the report that the passenger was detained. Scott family spokesman Ryan Julison confirmed to CNN that a man was with Scott and said he is not related to the family. The family declined to provide any more information. A timeline of events .

132,"(CNN)Hillary Clinton is finally announcing her candidacy for the 2016 presidential election. Although she has watched her standing in the polls sag in recent months, there is likely to be a boost in the days that follow the announcement. For Democrats, there is ample reason to be excited about Clinton's run for the presidency. She is certainly one of the strongest candidates in many decades. She brings to the table extensive political and policy experience, a combination of skills that is often lacking. She has been through some of the roughest partisan wars and emerged stronger than ever before. She has a keen sense about the nature of the modern news media, how to use it to her advantage and how to survive scandal frenzies. She is a hardened, tough partisan who will not shy away from Republican attack. Americans have many positive memories of Clinton name, given the booming economy of the late 1990s during Bill Clinton's presidency. If Hillary Clinton puts together an effective campaign, she could be unbeatable in the Democratic primaries as well as in the general election. However, during the buildup to her final decision, some of her weaknesses have also been exposed. Clinton doesn't want to end up like Vice President Al Gore in 2000. Although he did relatively well in the final election (with many Americans believing that he did actually defeat George W. Bush) he didn't generate much energy once the campaign started. Although he too was touted as a ""perfect"" candidate who was the ideal person for the job, something seemed stiff and inauthentic when he actually hit the trail. He seemed to freeze when the television cameras were rolling. Gore had trouble connecting with voters, and he seemed to remake his image constantly. His biggest asset ended up being that he was viewed as the inevitable nominee, rather than what he actually stood for. Clinton must avoid following Gore's path. She suffered this fate in the 2008 primaries and can't afford to do so again. She needs to do more than rest on the perception that her candidacy is inevitable and on her record of experience. That is not enough. More important is for her to put forth an exciting vision about what she would stand for in the White House. Voters thirst for signs of greatness when they pick their presidents, even if they are savvy enough to understand that the reality of a polarized Washington will probably limit her ability to achieve bold change. A recent story in The Washington Post suggests that her advisers are aware of this potential liability. After the announcement, they are going to avoid big rallies and events and instead concentrate on smaller events where she will meet with voters directly in states such as Iowa and New Hampshire. Clinton also will have to contend with doubts about her authenticity. In his first day on the campaign trail, Sen. Rand Paul immediately tapped into these concerns by raising questions about whether she could be trusted. That question has dogged the Clintons ever since they came onto the national political scene in the late 1980s. Their greatest virtue, their immense skills as politicians, has often come back to haunt them. Bill Clinton was attacked as ""slick Willie"" by members of both parties for the perception that he would say anything to win and Hillary Clinton has faced similar criticism. When she tried to distance herself from her vote for the use of force in Iraq, many Democrats didn't buy her critique of President George W. Bush's foreign policies and went for Barack Obama instead. When she conducted her ""listening tour"" of New York before running for the Senate, many voters saw it as a manufactured effort to hide the fact she was running for office as an outsider. When she explained that there was nothing to the recent stories about her use of a private email server rather than her State Department email, some felt that even if the story was relatively minor it indicated that she wasn't always telling us what she was really about. Even if she isn't hiding anything, she often gives that appearance. During the next few months, Clinton will also have to connect with her party's base. The ongoing speculation about Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has suggested that the most active part of the Democratic Party is not that enthused with Clinton's candidacy. While they will probably vote for her, they are not very motivated and don't trust that she will stand for Democratic values. She will need to address these concerns, not through her style but through her agenda. Voters will want to hear her talking about issues such as tougher financial regulation and policies to diminish economic inequality as well as her positions on race and policing. She will also need to make clear that she has heard voters on being too hawkish about going to war and give clear indications about how she would handle a nuclear agreement with Iran. Clinton will also have to contend with the gender bias that still exists in the electorate at large. Without any doubt she will be subject to questions and comments -- about her appearance, for instance -- that won't be aimed at male candidates. Part of her candidacy is itself an effort to break down these remaining vestiges of political sexism. But the struggle will be tough. Finally, and this relates to the last challenge, Clinton will have to contend with her husband. To be sure he can be an immense force on the campaign trail, one of the most compelling Democrats of our generation. But he can also be liability. As she learned in 2008, Bill Clinton is not always easy to control. When he speaks his mind, as he did in dismissive comments about Obama's candidacy, it can often work against her. The fund-raising records of the Clinton Foundation will also raise questions about conflict of interest, and ongoing stories about his personal life, as was the case when Monica Lewinsky returned to the media a few months ago, could re-emerge on the campaign trail. Whether that is fair or not is beside the point: Everything is fair game on the modern campaign trail. Hillary Clinton has the potential to be a hugely successful presidential candidate. But she and her campaign team will need to address the multiple questions and weaknesses that have become clear in recent months.",False,False,True,"Hillary Clinton has announced her candidacy for the 2016 presidential election, amidst a backdrop of both optimism and challenges. While she is seen as a strong Democratic candidate with extensive experience and resilience, akin to her husband’s positive legacy, she faces issues of authenticity and must avoid mistakes made by Al Gore in 2000. Her campaign plans to focus on small, direct voter engagements rather than large rallies. Clinton must address her party’s base concerns on issues like economic inequality and war, while also contending with gender bias and the potential liabilities posed by her association with Bill Clinton. Overall, her campaign faces challenges in authenticity and public perception."
